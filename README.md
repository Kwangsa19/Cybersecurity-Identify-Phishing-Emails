## Scenarios and Analysis

|Examples|Analysis|
|---|---|
|Scenario 1: <br> Hi, my name is Albert and I'm an FBI agent undercover in Uganda. My W.A.E email given to me during my highly classified investigation was recently burnt and now I have no way of passing critical intel back to HQ. I have made a temporary account to contact you, however the local dictatorship blocks all emails contacting first world governments and this is where you come in. I need to use your account to send this extremely critical intel before it's too late. This will require me accessing your email for security reasons. Thank you in advance. <br> Superintendent <br> Vincent FBI | This email makes the issue seem urgent, which is a common technique in phishing. No professionalism can be found here and asking for account details is inappropriate.  |
|Scenario 2: <br> Subject : Facebook is not working <br> From: Jimmy <br> To: me <br> Hey I think Facebook is down, I can't log in at all not matter what. <br> can you try? https://www.facibook.com.ipt/login.htm <br> Thanks, <br> Vinny | The email is from a cybercriminal. It asks the recipient to follow a link to see if Facebook is working on their end. The link itself is a fake because the name should be `facebook.com`. |
| Scenario 3: <br> From: X xx rewards <br> To: employee@xmail.com <br> Subject: reward card <br> Body: <br> Hello Simon cc <br> IN regoniztion to your hard work throughout the year, we wish to reward you with a gift card to spend in teh upcoming sales as a small token of our apprecition. Please find attached your Employee Reward card. The balance of this card will be determined based on your role. To view the balance click [here](). <br> From, <br> Staff Rewards Services | The grammar and spelling are not correct. There is no context as to what sales this email tells about. The link could be anything. In addition, there is no asking us to contact support for further information. |  

## How to spot phishing emails
* The grammar and spelling are not correct.
* Too generic and no context or whatsoever.
* Persuading us by writing `Urgent` word to urge us to take actions or similar like that.
* The link or attachment are not correct (spelling, the words, etc.)
* Suspicious looking source email address.
